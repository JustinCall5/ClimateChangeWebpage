<h3>What Is Climate Change?</h3>

<h3>What Are The Effects Of Climate Change</h3>

<p>
	As global temperatures continue to rise, so does the danger of deadly heat waves, rising sea levels , and the threats posed to global food security and water availability. During the past century human activities have released a substantial amount of Co2(Carbon Dioxide). Due to the burning of fossil fuels Co2 levels in our atmosphere have risen 69% from 280 ppm( parts per million) in 1750 to 407 ppm in 2018. As result the average global surface temperature rose from 0.07 to 0.98 degrees celsius between 1900 and 2019 according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. As of now the world's temperature is basically at 1 degree celsius above pre industrial levels. If we reach 2 degrees celsius the coral reefs may almost entirely disappear, ice sheets will collapse and etc.
